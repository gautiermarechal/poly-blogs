      <description>Introduction Nuclear energy: between emotional debates and incomprehension, it is time to really understand what nuclear energy is, in what forms we exploit it, and future projects to face present and future environmental challenges.
We will first explore the basic principles of this energy by looking at how an atom and its nucleus are made up.
Next, we will explore our engineering techniques to harness this energy.
And finally, we will understand what nuclear fusion consists of, its advantages and disadvantages, and the various future projects for exploiting this energy.</description>

      <description>When understood, some concepts can give the learner a completely new perspective of the world. Thermodynamics is one of them. This is a broad and generic subject that gives opportunity to parallel it with a lot of aspects in the world. Today we will parallel it with psychology, and more particularly to the human mind.
Thermodynamics is the science of heat, work, temperature and their relations to energy. Letâ€™s decompose these:</description>
