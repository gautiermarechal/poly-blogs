[{"content":"Introduction Nuclear energy: between emotional debates and incomprehension, it is time to really understand what nuclear energy is, in what forms we exploit it, and future projects to face present and future environmental challenges.\nWe will first explore the basic principles of this energy by looking at how an atom and its nucleus are made up.\nNext, we will explore our engineering techniques to harness this energy.\nAnd finally, we will understand what nuclear fusion consists of, its advantages and disadvantages, and the various future projects for exploiting this energy.\nNuclear energy: What is it? The definition of nuclear energy depends on the context of use. We are going to look at what nuclear energy is at the particle level.\nAn atom is made up of a nucleus and electrons orbiting around it. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. These particles are called nucleons. In order for these nucleons to hold together to form the nucleus, cohesion is present between them.\nAtom Nuclear energy is the energy associated with this cohesion. We can imagine this cohesion as a set of strings that bind the particles together. The tighter these ropes are, the stronger the sustaining energy. Releasing nuclear energy amounts to releasing the cohesive energy of the particles that make up the nucleus of the atom (nucleons). Release those taut strings that hold the nucleons together and see the energy coming out!\nBut how do you release those strings?\nThere are two ways for an atom to release nuclear energy: by nuclear reaction or by radioactivity.\nRadioactivity We designate certain atomic nuclei as “unstable” when the difference between the number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus is too great. To regain this stability, the nucleus decays into another nucleus. This disintegration emits particles and energy. Radioactivity refers to this disintegration. An atom is said to be radioactive when it spontaneously disintegrates emitting a significant amount of energy.\nThere are three different types of radioactivity: alpha beta and gamma, but we\u0026rsquo;ll explore them in another article.\nWhen a radioactive atom decays into another, by losing a neutron for example, this atom will become, in a way, another version of this same atom. This new version is called an isotope. Two atoms are isotopes if they share the same number of protons but their number of neutrons differ.\nHydrogen isotopes For example, the hydrogen atom has only one proton. There are two isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. Deuterium has one neutron and one proton. Tritium has 2 neutrons and 1 proton, which makes it a radioactive atom. If the tritium releases a neutron, it will become a deuterium atom and will have given off a large amount of energy.\nNuclear Reaction Unlike radioactivity, a nuclear reaction occurs with the interaction between an atomic nucleus and any other particle. A nuclear reaction results in a more stable nuclear configuration. Each nuclear reaction releases a certain amount of energy.\nThere are two types of nuclear reaction: fission and fusion.\nFission Nuclear fission takes place when a neutron strikes the nucleus of an atom and this nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei. During this fracture, a large amount of energy and several neutrons are released. It is this energy that we use in our nuclear reactors.\nWithin a reactor, a neutron is sent at high speed on a uranium 235 atom. This atom - being unstable - fragments releasing a large amount of energy accompanied by neutrons. These neutrons will then collide with new uranium 235 atoms which will in turn split. A chain reaction is set in motion.\nNuclear fission of uranium 235 atoms This chain reaction produces a lot of energy in the form of heat, which will heat liquid water into steam, powering a turbine to produce electricity. Simple isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nFor fusion, we also want to exploit the heat of reaction, but this heat is not as easy to obtain.\nMerge Fusion is combining two light atoms into one heavy nucleus. But how can energy be produced during this reaction?\nYou have probably already heard of the formula:\n$$e = mc²$$\n$$e: energy \\ m: mass \\ c: speed \\ of\\ light$$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use this formula to understand the basic principle of fusion.\nWe know that the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of the nucleons that compose it. How is it possible? If we build a wall with 3 bricks, the mass of the wall will be equal to the sum of the masses of the bricks, in this case 3 bricks.\nThis is not the case at the atomic scale. This difference between the mass of the nucleus and the mass of the nucleons that compose it is called mass defect.\nIt is this mass defect that we are going to exploit by combining two light cores into one heavy core. The latter actually represents the binding energy that will be released as kinetic energy. During the fusion of atoms, the collisions between particles degrade the kinetic energy into thermal energy, and it is this abundant heat that we want to exploit within a reactor.\nRepresentation of mass defect The amount of energy to fuse two atoms is very large. For two nuclei to combine, they must overcome the electrical repulsion between them, due to their respective positive charge. Overcoming this barrier requires a tremendous amount of energy under classical mechanics. Fortunately, quantum mechanics (the infinitely small), has shown us that this barrier can be crossed by the tunnel effect. This effect, only observable by quantum mechanics, stipulates that a particle can cross a sufficiently fine obstacle, with an energy smaller than the minimum energy to cross the obstacle.\nTunnel Effect This logic is completely counter-intuitive and shows quantum complexities that we are not going to discuss here for obvious reasons\u0026hellip;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just note that thanks to this barrier effect, the amount of energy to fuse two atoms is smaller than expected. But it is still very important.\nWe therefore need, to fuse two atoms, an environment under high pressure and temperature. Which atom requires less temperature and pressure to fuse together? The energy yield of the reaction must be positive: in other words, less energy is used than it is produced.\nAs seen before, atoms with a significant mass defect will release a large amount of energy if this binding energy is released.\nBut we must also be able to fuse these atoms. For this, we use atoms with light nuclei with a significant mass defect, such as hydrogen.\nBinding energy vs Mass On our Sun, fusion reactions consist of the fusion of 4 protium nuclei into a helium 4 nucleus. This is the most exothermic fusion reaction, but it requires pressure and temperature conditions that we only find on the surface of the Sun and that we would have too much trouble replicating on Earth.\nA more feasible reaction of fusing two deuterium atoms into a helium atom and a released neutron, noted below. The advantage of this reaction is the absence of radioactivity in the final product.\n$$^2 _1D+ ^2 _1D⟶ ^3 _2He(0,82 MeV)+ ^1_0n(2,45 MeV)$$\nMoreover, deuterium is very abundant in our seas. Indeed, one cubic meter of seawater contains 33 grams of deuterium, which can be extracted by electrolysis.\nAbundant deuterium in seawater But this reaction does not release much energy compared to the fusion of an atom of deuterium and tritium, as we can see noted below:\n$$ ^2_1D + ^3_1T \\longrightarrow ^4_2He (3,52MeV) + ^1 _0n (14,1MeV) $$\nFusion reaction of deuterium and tritium We know that we have deuterium in (almost) unlimited quantities. But what about tritium? The real problem lies in obtaining the tritium.\nTritium is not present in nature and the only way to get enough of it is to bombard a neutron on an atom of Lithium 6, an isotope of Lithium which is very rarely present in nature.\nEquation of fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium The idea is therefore to use the neutron created in the fusion of a deuterium and a tritium, and to put it in contact with a lithium 6 atom to produce tritium.\nThere are two problems that arise:\nWe therefore use fusion to produce tritium. But what if we don\u0026rsquo;t have tritium at the base to trigger the fusion reaction? The technology used to produce this tritium called “breeding blanket” is still very expensive and therefore less than 1% of the interior surfaces of a fusion device are covered with it. Lithium 6 is very scarce in nature. It represents 7.8% of the global stock of lithium in the world. Le problème de l’approvisionnement du tritium et du lithium 6 est un des plus gros défis de la fusion nucléaire. Beaucoup de recherches restent encore très actives sur ces sujets comme des propositions de séparation de lithium intégrée aux systèmes afin de pouvoir utiliser le lithium 7, encore très abondant dans la nature.\nLa fusion nucléaire présente encore de multiples défis avant de pouvoir être industrialisée. Mais ces défis sont résolubles et la recherche dans le domaine reste très active. La fusion nucléaire est une des sources énergétiques les plus plausibles pour remplacer le pétrole dans le prochain centenaire, en terme de quantité, mais aussi de propreté. Les emissions de gaz à effet de serre reste très basse par rapport à la quantité d’énergie produite.Mais il faudra encore attendre que la recherche scientifique résolve ses différents problèmes.\nThe problem of the supply of tritium and lithium 6 is one of the biggest challenges of nuclear fusion. Much research is still very active on these subjects, such as proposals for the separation of lithium integrated into systems in order to be able to use lithium 7, which is still very abundant in nature.\nNuclear fusion still presents multiple challenges before it can be industrialized. But these challenges are solvable and research in the field remains very active. Nuclear fusion is one of the most plausible energy sources to replace oil in the next century, in terms of quantity, but also cleanliness. Greenhouse gas emissions remain very low compared to the amount of energy produced. But we will still have to wait for scientific research to solve its various problems.\nResources https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_energy\n[https://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/radiation/introduction-to-radiation/atoms-nuclides-radioisotopes.cfm#:~:text=Atoms are stable when,%2C the atom becomes unstable] (https://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/radiation/introduction-to-radiation/atoms-nuclides-radioisotopes.cfm#:~:text=The%20atoms%20are%20stable%20when,%2C%20l atom%20becomes%20unstable).\n[https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/dossiers/physique-voyage-coeur-matiere-176/page/7/](https://www.futura-sciences.com/sciences/dossiers/physique -travel-heart-matter-176/page/7/)\n[https://www.andra.fr/les-dechets-radioactif/la-radioactivite/explication-du-phenomene](https://www.andra.fr/les-dechets-radioactif/la-radioactivite/explication- of-the-phenomenon)\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effet_tunnel\n[https://www.iter.org/fr/sci/fusionfuels#:~:text=To obtain deuterium%2C il,for scientific and industrial purposes](https://www.iter.org/fr/sci /fusionfuels#:~:text=To%20get%20of%20deut%C3%A9rium%2C%20il,%20for%20scientific%20and%20industrial purposes).\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092037961930835X?via%3Dihub\n","permalink":"https://poly-blogs.com/en/posts/nuclear-energy-fission-fusion/","summary":"Introduction Nuclear energy: between emotional debates and incomprehension, it is time to really understand what nuclear energy is, in what forms we exploit it, and future projects to face present and future environmental challenges.\nWe will first explore the basic principles of this energy by looking at how an atom and its nucleus are made up.\nNext, we will explore our engineering techniques to harness this energy.\nAnd finally, we will understand what nuclear fusion consists of, its advantages and disadvantages, and the various future projects for exploiting this energy.","title":"Nuclear energy - fission and fusion"},{"content":"Today, we are tackling transistors, these small electronic components that have revolutionized the world of computing since their very first creation in the 1920s. What is a transistor, how does it work and why is it? what so important? And what is the future of transistors? Let\u0026rsquo;s explore this.\nThe story of its invention At the beginning of the 20th century, modern electronics grew with the aim of better controlling the electric current applied to a circuit in order to build increasingly sophisticated machines. At that time, vacuum tubes were used for these purposes as switches and amplifiers in circuits.\nHowever, these components present a major problem: their size. Indeed, the first vacuum tube computers took up a lot of space for their capacity. For example, the Colossus, in service since 1943, is considered the first programmable computer in history. It took up the entire space in a living room, weighed 8 tons, to perform simple arithmetic calculations.\nThe Collosus computer - 1943 Physicists of the time knew that vacuum tubes could be replaced. In 1925, Julius Lilienfeld, an Austro-Hungarian physicist filed the first patent for the field effect transistor. A little later, Oskar Heil also filed a patent for this same type of transistor in 1935. But it was not until 1947 that the first transistor was actually created, in the Bell laboratories in New Jersey.\nWhat is it and how does it work? Control the current A transistor is a component that controls the movement of electrons like a faucet controls the movement of water. We open the tap to let the water flow and control its flow rate; the amount of water coming out per unit of time.\nA transistor does the same with electrons.\nThe transistor is made up of three pieces of metal called electrodes. There is the emitter (the entrance of the electrons), the base (the electrode where the current is controlled) and the collector (the exit of the electrons) .\nElectrodes Transistor The collector lets electrons in, and the emitter lets electrons out. In the middle is the base electrode which will decide whether or not the electrons will pass. If a voltage is applied to this base electrode, current will flow through the transistor. They say he will be led. However, if the base receives no voltage, no current flows. What differentiates a transistor from a simple switch is that you can decide how many electrons pass through it.\nThese cases of figures give the term of semiconductor to the transistor: the transistor can conduct the current or not. It is also from this behavior that the etymology of the word transistor was born: transfer resistor in English, or transfer resistance.\nA semiconductor atom An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons in orbital shells around the nucleus. The last of these shells is called the Valence layer. Above this Valence layer is the conduction band. When an electron reaches this conduction band, it breaks free from the atom to move to other atoms. That\u0026rsquo;s electric current.\nThere are therefore three types of atoms:\nKind Description Insulating atom Its Valence layer is saturated with electrons, there is no more room and the conduction band is far away. conductive atom Its Valence layer can accommodate new electrons and the conduction band is at the same level as the Valence layer. Semiconductor atom Its Valence layer is saturated with electrons but the conduction band is very close to it. If we give enough energy, the electrons can pass into the conduction band and free themselves to pass the current. The NPN and PNP layers In a transistor, we use these electrical properties to control this current.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive inside the transistor to see what it hides.\nInside we find two types of component layers: type N and type P.\nAn N-type shell is a block of atoms with excess electrons. This block will therefore want to give up its electrons.\nA P-type shell is a block of electron-starved atoms. It will therefore want to receive electrons.\nNPN and PNP Layers By applying these layers following excess (N), lack (P), excess (N) or lack (P), excess (N), lack (P), if we do pass a minimum of 0.7V in the system, the current will pass, otherwise it will not pass. The N shells will donate electrons to the P shells.\nFor a more detailed explanation of the process, I refer you to the following video [https://youtu.be/Ey1nnEoADcg?t=705].\nWhy is this useful? Nowadays, transistors are found in any electronic device that we use. From the washing machine to the computer via the smartphone, transistors are the basis of the electronic circuits of our devices.\nBy being able to let the current flow or not with an electrical voltage, we can associate several transistors together to let the current flow at a precise state. For example, if we want an LED to light up when 2 buttons are pressed at the same time, we can use a transistor linked to each button which will let current flow if the button is pressed.\nBut then why not use the buttons directly?\nWell if we multiply this number of gates to let or not the current pass, the mechanical switches become ineffective. Indeed, if we were to associate hundreds of logic gates to make calculations automatically, the switches would be too slow, the mechanical aspect leads to more probabilities of technical problems and the space taken up would be too large.\nThis is why transistors are used everywhere in computing. They allow the electronic circuits of our devices to open and close the current very quickly, and therefore increase the speed of calculation.\nExamples of uses Flash memory (USB key, SSD disk, etc.) We can link the value 0 to an isolating transistor and a value of 1 to a passing transistor. If we have these transistors in series, each value of the transistor on or off will give a series of 0s and 1s which therefore represents information (a text, a technical image, etc.) In the chip below, billions of transistors are arranged to represent information. Flash Memory Processors (CPUs) The transistors arranged in the processor make it possible to perform complex calculations, forming the basis of computing.

However, some groups have not always agreed together, causing multiple conflicts that shaped our history. Cryptography has shown itself as a tool to make communication between two parties secret to any other partie. This tool has been way more important than we think, and we will explore how it shaped history in the past, in the present and in the future. In a world where huge entities and governments are more and more present in individuals’ daily lives, securing data with cryptography will be an essential tool to have in hand.\nCryptography has existed for thousands of years.\nThe first form of cryptography has been observed in ancient Egypt on tomb walls in 1900 BC. Unusual symbols were carved on the tomb of Knumotep II to confuse the reader and enhance mystery.\nMoreover, in 5 BC, spartans created a cryptographic device called a Scytale. The tool was a stick wrapped with a piece of leather carrying the message. It was readable only when wrapped on this particular diameter cylinder allowing letters to align. The recipient of the message needed the exact same diameter Scytale to decrypt the message.\nSpartan Scytale Another great example is the Caesar cipher, named after the emperor who created this technique to secretly communicate in an era of treachery. The technique is known as substitution, consisting of each letter being replaced with another that only the recipient knows.\nCaesar Cipher There are multiple other historic examples of cryptography used in the ancient world, that allowed interactions to remain secret between two parties.\nDuring history, cryptography was often used by the governing monarchs or emperors to communicate internally. The communications encryptions were often dedicated for military planning or any religious piece of writings. Julius Caesar used his famous cipher to organize strategies with his generals. The Greek Magical Papyri from 100 BCE contained rituals, hymns and spells written in a special language with ancient greek that was impossible to read for a normal reader. Creating encrypted messages was meant to keep communication secrets within groups, and form exclusivity for members of the group. The ciphers were only known by these members.\nHowever, in the 700s, Al-Khali, an arab philologist wrote the first documentation of a cryptographic techniques standard called Book of Cryptographic Messages. This was the first time a formal documentation of techniques existed. This gave a new approach vision to cryptography. The science continued to be nourished in the 800s, when Al-Kindi invented frequency analysis, the measure of letters frequency in the arab language. This was the first ever known cryptography breaking technique ever invented and marked the start of the field. However, we would not see any major advances until WW2.\nGeneric Frequency Analysis Table During WW2, Germans created and used the famous rotor machine called Enigma. The machine was basically made of a keyboard, a lampboard and a set of rotors in between. Typing a letter on the keyboard would lighten a different letter on the lampboard. This substitution was made possible via specific wiring controlled by the rotor, that would change the connections depending on the configuration that the user could change manually. This allowed the machine to operate a polyalphabetic substitution, meaning that each letter could be replaced by different letters. The alphabet was replaceable by multiple alphabets. All the functioning was electromechanical.\nEnigma Machine used by Nazis during WW2 This machine was a major technological advancement at the time, and so was its breaking by the British with Ultra. Germans communicated military information via morse codes on radio that was written initially with Enigma. Communications were unbreakable and allowed Germans to take advantage of the field. When the British broke the machine, Allies took back the advantage to win and end the war. According to estimates, the war was shortened by two to four years with the breaking.\nAll the previous cryptographic techniques or machines were mainly using lexicography and hardware. With the arrival of computing, the same principle of hiding messages had been translated to software.\nModern cryptography makes use of mathematics to encrypt data into an unreadable data. The message sent is encrypted into a set of unreadable characters, via a complex mathematical algorithm.\nThere are two main types of cryptography techniques nowadays: symmetric-key and asymmetric-key (or public-key cryptography).\nSymmetric Key Symmetric key cryptography is when the sender and the receiver share the same key encrypt and decrypt the message. If Alice sends a message to Bob, the message will be encrypted with Alice’s key and Bob will use this same key to decrypt the message. Symmetric keys are implemented as three different methods: block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions.\nSymmetric Key Cryptographic Method Schema To make it simple, block ciphers are encryption of fixed-length f blocks of texts and stream ciphers are encrypting each single character by combining them to digits in the key stream.\nBlock Cipher Schema Stream Cipher Schema Both are dictated by a deterministic algorithm.\nA deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given an input, will always produce the same output with that specific input.\nFinally, hash functions are one way functions that will encrypt a message input into a fixed array output of digits. Hash functions are not reversible and the only way to find the input is to brute force the function and match all the results with the fixed array we have. However, the number of possibilities is enormous. This is what makes hash functions a powerful tool.\nHash Function Schema The main problem with symmetric key cryptography is to exchange the key between the sender and the recipient. This allows for security breach as usually nowadays, cryptography is operated on the internet and the two parties cannot meet in secret to exchange the key. This is where asymmetric cryptography comes into play.\nAsymmetric Key In 1976, researchers highlighted the security issue of having one single key for encryption and decryption and proposed a system of a public key and private key pair. An encrypted communication would use a public-key to encrypt the message, and a private key to decrypt it. The public key can be distributed freely whereas the private key must remain secret. Both keys are mathematically related but this relation is complex and requires a difficult problem solving.\nThe main advance in this method is that the receiver who uses the public key to decrypt the message, in reality verifies that the message has been created by someone who possesses the corresponding private key.\nAsymmetric Key Schema Let’s say, Alice and Bob both have key pairs. Alice knows Bob’s public key and the contrary is also true. If Alice encrypts a message with Bob’s public key and sends it to Bob, Bob will be able to use his private key to verify that the message has been sent and encrypted by Alice with Bob’s public key. Therefore, the communication is completely secure and both parties do not need to exchange anything privately. Everything is based on verification. If a third party, named John intercepts the message, he will know Bob’s public key but won’t be able to verify the message with its private key. Because a pair of keys are mathematically related, John’s private key does not correspond to Bob’s public key. He would need Bob’s private key to decrypt the message. This cryptography solution based on verification has been a groundbreaking advance in the field, but also in history in general.\nAs stated above, cryptography has always been used in history by large instances as military forces and governments. With the arrival of computing and the internet, the power is incrementally shifting from vertical to horizontal. Individuals nowadays have way more power than before compared with high instances as governments. The equality of opportunities has significantly increased with the internet, opening a large set of path alternatives for people.\nThanks to the internet people are more free, but still large entities control a large amount of internet users. Huge companies as Google, Facebook or Amazon possess private data of their users, breaking the decentralized model cryptography has to offer. However, this is subject to change. People’s trust toward these giants is shifting, as the awareness of the situation is increasing. Scandals as Cambridge Analytica highlight the excess of power these instances possess.\nThe internet has become a panopticon. A panopticon was a type of architecture used in prisons, designed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The concept was that a single guard was placed in the middle of a circular room, allowing all the prisoners to be possibly observed by the guard. It was physically impossible for the guard to monitor all the inmates. The main idea was that the inmates would feel constantly observed, not knowing where the guard would look at a certain point in time. They would constantly act as they were being watched. This is exactly the same feeling the internet is giving to people. A psychological war is constantly engaged in our private activities on the web.\nPanopticon Prison The model of huge internet companies might start shifting. As an example, the app Signal to communicate privately marks the arrival of a new model: an open-source NGO, relied entirely on donations and verification of peer-reviewers. Reviewers who are people like you and me, verify that the Signal cryptographic protocols used to encrypt message communications are correct and trusty. This model starts to grab the attention of many users. In January 2021, 20 million users shifted from Whatsapp to Signal after Facebook announced it would be able to access Whatsapp data.\nThis model of power is also (mostly) present in Bitcoin. Created in 2009, Bitcoin fundamentals rely mostly on cryptography. Asymmetric key cryptography is used in Bitcoin, allowing users to privately transact, stopping any third party as a government or a company to interfere in the process. It is the first time in history that individuals have this power in their hands. All thanks to mathematics and cryptography.\nIf a communication tool and a currency become completely sovereign, distinct from a centralized instance, what is the limit? This model can be applicable to any other online tool with cryptography being the main pillar of this revolutionary system.\n","permalink":"https://poly-blogs.com/en/posts/cryptography-implications/","summary":"Human success on the planet has been made possible thanks to our ability to communicate in the purpose of solving complex problems as groups.

Since 200,000 years, humans have accumulated an immense set of knowledge in many different fields. Doing so has been possible with abstraction, a concept that helps us grow our knowledge in a lot of different ways. We will explore what abstraction is with a philosophy perspective, to help us understand abstraction in computer science and the human brain.\nOne of the most popular reflections of abstraction in philosophy has been made by John Locke in 1689. In book III, Locke mentions that in the language, we use general terms to speak about particulars. The reason is that there are too many particulars to think about, and it would be an overwhelming task for the mind to remember all the specifics. Therefore, we use general terms as words that classify specific things under a group. This classification is made possible with abstraction.\nJohn Locke — British Philosopher (1632–1704) For example, the word “horse” encompasses anything that resembles a horse in your perception. All these particular elements in the group are linked by the essence that makes each element part of the group. And this essence is the result of the abstract ideas that you have of horses. Abstraction forms the essence in the mind and creates knowledge as a whole.\nNow, what is clearly an abstraction? The roots of the word define something abstracted as “something pulled or drawn away”. This is exactly the process that the mind engages in when grouping ideas as mentioned above. It converts the real element to a mental appearance (or idea) and detaches the latter from any real-life features as space or time.\nSo there is the process:\nMind identifies a real thing Converts it to idea Detaches from real life Observe the essence of the element Group the element under a general idea = an abstract idea. Now let’s identify abstraction in Computer Science, a human created field, and see how this process of abstraction can be reflected in this field.\nA computer contains a CPU, the brain of the computer. The CPU receives electric current through its architecture. The wiring inside the CPU will interpret an electric current as a 1 and an absence of electric current as a 0. These sets of 1s and 0s are instructions sent from the RAM to the CPU, telling it to execute certain things. Then, when the CPU knows what to do, it will process instructions again as electric current to other components on the motherboard.\nTo execute such tasks, the CPU needs to perform computations under the form of calculations. These calculations are made possible with logic gates. Logic gates are electronic components called transistors, that we find on the electric board. A logic gate accepts electric current as input and will output a 0 or a 1. The output depends on the input, and there are different logic gates that will have different logic to output the result.\nAll types of logic gates and their logic tables Let’s take the AND gate. It outputs a 1 only if all the inputs are 1s, otherwise it outputs a 0. So if we give 1 and 0, the result will be 0.\nNow imagine an entire electronic board made of a large amount of these gates, and the possibilities of calculations.\nThe AND logic gate All the things mentioned above are at the physical level, or the lowest level of abstraction possible. This means that we are the closest of reality, as electricity is a natural process of electrons flowing through material. Now let’s increase the level of abstraction from electric current to structured set of instructions.\nWhere do all these instructions originally come from?\nThe answer is programs. Computer programs are just a way for humans to send instructions to the CPU. Now we are a level of abstraction higher from the physical level.\nCompiler In computer programs, there are several levels of abstraction depending on their “distance” from the physical components of the motherboard.\nLevels of Abstraction — Computer Languages The lowest programming language is the machine language, that contains functions as bits, sent directly to the CPU.\nInstruction in Machine Code Then, if we increase the level of abstraction, or in other words, detach even more from the reality of electric current, we have assembly language.\nAssembly Language contains instructions that are human understandable, to communicate with the CPU. For example, the “MOV” instruction allows assembly languages to tell the CPU to move data into a specific place.\nInstruction in Assembly Language Now let’s move up again to the higher abstraction level and see high-level languages.\nHigh-level languages are programming languages with which programmers can use natural language to write programs that will send instructions to the CPU. In Java, which is a high-level language, you will write System.out.print(“Hello World”); to display on the monitor “Hello World”.\nThe word “print” directly matches the idea of printing for the programmer, making the language convenient to use.\nJava Program The language will be translated to assembly language via a compiler, and then the assembly language will give machine code, instructing the CPU.\nAnd above all, are visual languages or even the input from a user. The input will trigger high level language instructions that will trigger the cascade stated before.\nAll these different levels in the computer language are all linked thanks to abstraction. This process is similar to the abstract ideas that John Locke discussed in the 17th century. Similarly to specific ideas in the mind transformed to general ideas by abstraction, the specific that is the electric current is translated through multiple layers to the level of understanding for humans. The electric current that is real, is seen as a mental appearance, detached from reality, transformed into natural word languages. These natural word languages are programming languages that we use nowadays and that dictates a large part of our societies.\n","permalink":"https://poly-blogs.com/en/posts/abstraction-mind-computers/","summary":"The concept of abstraction is fundamentally essential and rooted in human existence.

Thermodynamics is one of them. This is a broad and generic subject that gives opportunity to parallel it with a lot of aspects in the world. Today we will parallel it with psychology, and more particularly to the human mind.\nThermodynamics is the science of heat, work, temperature and their relations to energy. Let’s decompose these:\nHeat: the energy transferred between two systems as a result of their differences in temperature. Work: the energy transferred between two systems in the form of physical displacement. Temperature: the measure of energy released from vibration of molecules in a system. Energy: the measure that a system will need to transfer to perform work and heat Different forms of energies in a collision between two physical systems. So as of now, we know that thermodynamics refer to isolated systems interacting between each other. We know that energy is used by any system under different forms. When riding a bike, the chemical energy in your muscles (ATP) is converted to mechanical energy in the bike pedals, which will move the bike and heat in your muscles.\nTherefore in this example, we clearly have a transfer of energy between two systems (person and bike), that results in heat and work (heat in the muscles, work in the movement of the bike). All this energy is not produced but converted. This is the first law of thermodynamics: energy cannot be produced or destroyed but can be converted to different forms. The amount of energy in the whole universe stays the same.\nAll this energy is manipulated by systems in the universe. Depending on its form, energy is more or less “useful” for a system. For example, energy as heat alone will not move the bike we are riding. This concept of energy quality is associated with the degree of disorder of the energy within the system. The measure of this disorder is called entropy.\nDegree of entropy (disorder) of two systems at microscopic level. Entropy is the measure of unavailable energy in a system, which reflects the amount of disorder of that energy. The more entropy, the more disordered and less useful this energy is. This is what the second law of thermodynamics states: the entropy in the entire universe as an isolated system will increase overtime.\nHowever, we can observe that living beings on the planet are well structured, their entropy is low. This is because these systems are not isolated but open. They exchange energy with other systems in the universe to reduce their own entropy.\nStill, the universe is a closed system. And as the second law of thermodynamics states it, all isolated systems tend towards disorder or high entropy. So these open systems when exchanging energy will increase the entropy of the whole universe.\nNow, let’s dive into the theory of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on the order of the human mind. Mihaly says that “The normal state of the mind is chaos”. We order the mind with outside stimuli that grab our attention. Without these stimuli, the mind focuses on negative thoughts and pain. In other words, the human mind tends toward disorder, the same way an isolated system tends towards high entropy in thermodynamics. The human mind finds order by exchanging energy with external open systems, such as TV, Books or any other activity.\nThe paradox is that the human mind is an open system but behaves thermodynamically as an isolated system. This is what life forms are about: reducing their entropy by interacting with the outside world.\nThe reduction of entropy in the mind depends on the type of activity that stimulates it. The more mental energy that is used in the activity, the more structured the mind will be. Remember that there is a fixed amount of energy in the universe. The mental energy used in an activity will be allocated elsewhere in the universe. Social media and entertainment companies want your attention at its maximum simplicity. Hence, the mind will use low amounts of energy when being stimulated by these activities. Less energy will have less impact on the entropy in your mind, giving you an illusion of order. However, this degree of order is not as high as if you used greater quantities of energy in the activity.\nTo summarize, the mind is an open system that exchanges energy with outside systems to reduce its own entropy and therefore structure itself. The type of exchanges the mind does with these systems will vary the reduction of entropy.\n","permalink":"https://poly-blogs.com/en/posts/thermo-and-human-mind/","summary":"When understood, some concepts can give the learner a completely new perspective of the world.
