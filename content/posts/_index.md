Poly is a science, history and philosophy blog to arouse the curiosity of its readers. This blog aspires to be generalist. In each post, a subject is treated in an introductory way, without remaining too superficial. The idea is to get the first technical aspects of the subject, so that the reader understands, without the post being illegible and boring.

This blog has no claim to become a serious scientific journal. It exists for the sole purpose of providing interesting content for readers with a thirst for learning. The idea is to provide valuable information in this sea of noise that overwhelms us on the internet.

The content is totally free, but if you want to support me you can at this following link.

Thank you and good reading!
